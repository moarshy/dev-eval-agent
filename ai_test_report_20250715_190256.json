    "executive_summary": "The Restcountries API demonstrates excellent functional reliability, with all 20 executed tests across two pages passing successfully, resulting in a 100% overall success rate. This indicates a robust and consistent API. However, a critical area for improvement is the documentation. Specifically, the `/v3.1/all` endpoint's \"documentation\" is an error message, forcing users to infer required parameters and valid fields. This significantly hinders developer experience. While the main page's documentation quality could not be fully assessed due to an internal analysis error, the identified issues on the `/v3.1/all` endpoint suggest a systemic lack of comprehensive and explicit API documentation.",
    "overall_documentation_assessment": "The overall documentation quality is assessed as Poor, primarily based on the detailed analysis of the `/v3.1/all` endpoint. The \"documentation\" for this critical endpoint is merely an error message, lacking explicit instructions, valid parameter lists, or usage examples. This forces users to infer API behavior, which is a significant barrier to adoption and efficient use. The inability to fully analyze the main page's documentation due to an internal error means this assessment is heavily weighted by the `/v3.1/all` endpoint's deficiencies.",
