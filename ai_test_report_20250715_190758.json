    "executive_summary": "The RestCountries API demonstrates exceptional functional robustness and reliability, achieving a 100% success rate across all 20 tests conducted. The API consistently handles various requests, including complex queries and error conditions, as expected. However, the overall documentation quality is inconsistent. While the main documentation is excellent, providing clear and accurate information, the documentation for specific endpoints, such as `/v3.1/all`, is critically deficient, lacking essential details like mandatory parameters and successful usage examples. This inconsistency poses a significant barrier to developer experience for certain API paths. The tool is functionally ready for use, but immediate attention is required to standardize and complete the documentation, particularly for critical endpoints.",
    "overall_documentation_assessment": "The documentation quality is highly variable. The main documentation page (`https://restcountries.com`) is assessed as \"Excellent,\" providing clear, concise, and accurate information, including explicit mentions of mandatory parameters and unsupported features, along with helpful examples. In stark contrast, the documentation for the `/v3.1/all` endpoint is rated \"Poor.\" It is incomplete, misleading, and fails to explicitly state mandatory parameters (like `fields`), provide examples of successful API calls, or document the expected response structure. This inconsistency is a major concern, as it forces users to infer critical usage details for specific, important endpoints.",

    "strength_areas": [
      "API Functional Robustness: The API itself is highly reliable and performs consistently, achieving a 100% test pass rate.",
      "Excellent Error Handling (API-side): The API correctly returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) for invalid or unsupported requests, which is crucial for building resilient applications.",
      "Comprehensive Main Documentation: The primary documentation page is clear, accurate, and provides good examples, setting a high standard for the rest of the documentation.",

      "page_summary": "The REST Countries API documentation (version 3.1) provides a comprehensive guide to retrieving country information through various RESTful endpoints. It covers searching by name (common and full), country codes (cca2, ccn3, cca3, cioc), currency, demonym, language, capital city, region, subregion, and translation. Key features include mandatory field filtering for the `/all` endpoint and a dedicated endpoint for independent countries. The testing approach covered a wide array of these functionalities, including basic data retrieval, exact matches, batch requests, and crucial error handling for missing parameters and unsupported operations (like calling code search). All 18 defined test scenarios passed successfully, validating the API's adherence to its documentation.",
      "documentation_quality": "Excellent. The documentation is clear, concise, and highly accurate for the API endpoints and features tested. A significant strength is the explicit mention of mandatory parameters (e.g., 'fields' for '/all') and the clear statement about unsupported features (e.g., searching by calling codes in V3), which prevents user frustration and aligns perfectly with the API's actual behavior. The provided example URLs are helpful and directly usable. The 100% test pass rate strongly affirms the quality and completeness of the documentation for the covered functionalities.",
