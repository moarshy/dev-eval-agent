Although the original project has now moved to a subscription base API, this project is still Open Source and Free to use.\n## Important Information\n  * The structure of V2 has been reverted to its original form from the \n  * **_Only the latest version will receive updates and improvements._**\n\n\n# REST Countries\nYou can access API through <https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all> but in order to get a faster response, you should filter the results by the fields you need. Like\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,flags`\n```\n\n# Contributing\nAny help is always welcome! Just edit the relevant file and create a new Merge Request or you can also donate using \n# Donations\nThis are getting out of control (in a positive way). I\u2019m getting about 4 million hits **each day** and that means CPU ussage (sometimes at 99%) and also bandwidth consumption (120 GB **per day!**) so costs have obviously increased. **Please** , consider making a donation on \n# Fields (mandatory)\nYou can check the **must** specify the fields you need (up to 10 fields) when calling the `all` endpoints.\n# API Endpoints\n## Using this Project\n# Endpoints\nBelow are described the REST endpoints available that you can use to search for countries\n## Latest added Enpoint\n### Independent\nNow you can get all independent (or not independent) countries by calling this endpoint:\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?status=true\n```\n\nIf you don\u2019t specify the status, true will be taken as default. You can mix it with the `fields` filter like this:\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?status=true&fields=languages,capital\n```\n\n## All\nYou **must** specify the fields you need (up to 10 fields) when calling the `all` endpoints, otherwise you\u2019ll get a `bad request` response. Please see \n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/all\n```\n\n## Name\n**Search** by country name. If you want to get an exact match, use the next endpoint. It can be the common or official value\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}\n```\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/eesti\n```\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/deutschland\n```\n\n## Full Name\nSearch by country\u2019s full name.

Like\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,flags`\n```\n\n# Contributing\nAny help is always welcome! Just edit the relevant file and create a new Merge Request or you can also donate using \n# Donations\nThis are getting out of control (in a positive way). I\u2019m getting about 4 million hits **each day** and that means CPU ussage (sometimes at 99%) and also bandwidth consumption (120 GB **per day!**) so costs have obviously increased. **Please** , consider making a donation on \n# Fields (mandatory)\nYou can check the **must** specify the fields you need (up to 10 fields) when calling the `all` endpoints.\n# API Endpoints\n## Using this Project\n# Endpoints\nBelow are described the REST endpoints available that you can use to search for countries\n## Latest added Enpoint\n### Independent\nNow you can get all independent (or not independent) countries by calling this endpoint:\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?status=true\n```\n\nIf you don\u2019t specify the status, true will be taken as default. You can mix it with the `fields` filter like this:\n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?status=true&fields=languages,capital\n```\n\n## All\nYou **must** specify the fields you need (up to 10 fields) when calling the `all` endpoints, otherwise you\u2019ll get a `bad request` response. Please see \n```\nhttps://restcountries.com/v3.1/all\n```\n\n## Name\n**Search** by country name. If you want to get an exact match, use the next endpoint.

To ensure the `requests` library, necessary for making HTTP calls, was available, an attempt was made to install it. The installation was successful, confirming the library's readiness.\n\nNext, the core test logic was executed. This involved making two GET requests to the `restcountries.com` API:\n1.  `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/NonExistentCountryName`\n2.  `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/InvalidRegion`\n\nFor both requests, the API returned a `404 Not Found` status code with a JSON body `{\"message\":\"Not Found\",\"status\":404}`.\n\nThe `expected_outcome` for the scenario was: \"The API should return an empty array or a specific 'not found' response (e.g., 404 Not Found) indicating no results, rather than a server error.\"\n\nSince both requests resulted in a `404 Not Found` response, which perfectly matches the expected behavior for non-existent resources, the test is classified as PASSED. No server errors (5xx) were encountered, and the response format was as expected for an error."
