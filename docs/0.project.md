# DevTool Evaluator Agent
## Project Document v1.0

---

## Executive Summary

We propose building a specialized AI coding agent that systematically evaluates developer tools for "agent usability" - how well they work with AI-assisted development workflows. This agent will ingest documentation, generate comprehensive test plans, execute evaluation tasks, and produce detailed observability traces using OpenTelemetry standards.

**Key Value Proposition**: The first AI system specifically designed to audit developer tools for the AI-assisted development era, providing actionable insights through systematic testing and observability.

## Problem Statement

### Current Market Gap
- **Developer tool companies** lack visibility into where users struggle during onboarding and implementation
- **No standardized methodology** exists for evaluating "agent-friendliness" of developer tools
- **General-purpose coding agents** provide inconsistent evaluation results
- **Manual testing** is time-intensive and lacks systematic coverage

### Business Impact
- Dev tools lose potential users due to poor onboarding experiences
- Companies cannot prioritize improvements based on real usage data
- The rise of AI-assisted development creates new usability requirements that aren't being measured

```python
# Example generated test code with embedded tracing
from opentelemetry import trace
import stripe

tracer = trace.get_tracer("devtool-evaluator")

def test_stripe_create_customer():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("stripe_create_customer") as span:
        span.set_attributes({
            'tool.name': 'stripe',
            'tool.category': 'payment_api', 
            'test.category': 'basic_usage',
            'test.difficulty': 'beginner'
        })
        
        try:
            # Generated implementation code
            stripe.api_key = os.getenv('STRIPE_API_KEY')
            customer = stripe.Customer.create(
                email='test@example.com',
                name='Test Customer'
            )
            
            span.set_attributes({
                'execution.success': True,
                'stripe.customer_id': customer.id,
                'code.lines_executed': 3
            })
            return customer
            
        except Exception as e:
            span.set_attributes({
                'execution.success': False,
                'error.type': type(e).__name__,
                'error.message': str(e)
            })
            span.record_exception(e)
