# Strategic Tool Selection for Agent Testing

You need a graduated test suite that starts simple and progressively gets more complex. Here's how to systematically identify good testing targets:

## Tool Selection Framework

### Complexity Dimensions to Test

üìä **Documentation Quality**: Clear ‚Üí Confusing ‚Üí Missing  
üîß **Setup Complexity**: pip install ‚Üí Multi-step ‚Üí Enterprise setup  
üéØ **Task Difficulty**: Hello World ‚Üí Real workflows ‚Üí Production deployment  
üêõ **Error Scenarios**: Good errors ‚Üí Generic errors ‚Üí Silent failures  

## Python Tool Categories (Ordered by Testing Value)

### 1. APIs (Start Here - Most Predictable)

**Simple (Week 1 Testing):**
- **OpenWeatherMap API** - Clear docs, simple auth, good errors
- **JSONPlaceholder API** - No auth, perfect for basic HTTP testing
- **GitHub API** - Well documented, token auth, clear error messages

**Medium Complexity:**
- **Stripe API** - Good docs but complex workflows (webhooks, etc.)
- **Twilio API** - Multiple products, phone/SMS workflows
- **SendGrid API** - Email workflows, template management

**Complex (Stress Testing):**
- **AWS SDK (boto3)** - Massive API surface, complex auth, poor error messages
- **Google Cloud APIs** - Complex auth flows, service account setup
- **Kubernetes Python Client** - Complex setup, YAML configs, cluster dependencies

### 2. Frameworks (Good for Workflow Testing)

**Medium:**
- **Docker SDK** - Container management, image building
- **Terraform CDK (Python)** - Infrastructure as code, complex concepts
- **Pulumi** - Cloud infrastructure, multiple providers

## Recommended Testing Sequence

### Week 1: Baseline Testing (3 tools)

```python
test_targets_week1 = [
    {
        "name": "OpenWeatherMap API",
        "type": "api",
        "complexity": "simple",
        "why": "Perfect docs, clear auth, predictable responses",
        "expected_score": "8-9/10"
    },
    {
        "name": "Requests library", 
        "type": "library",
        "complexity": "simple",
        "why": "Gold standard docs, simple import, clear examples",
        "expected_score": "9-10/10"
    },
    {
        "name": "FastAPI",
        "type": "framework", 
        "complexity": "simple",
        "why": "Modern docs, interactive examples, clear setup",
        "expected_score": "8-9/10"
    }
]
```

### Week 2: Reality Check (3 tools)

```python
test_targets_week2 = [
    {
        "name": "Stripe API",
        "type": "api", 
        "complexity": "medium",
        "why": "Good docs but complex workflows (webhooks, etc.)",
        "expected_issues": "Webhook setup, testing complexity"
    },
    {
        "name": "CrewAI",
        "type": "ai_framework",
        "complexity": "medium", 
        "why": "Popular but emerging, documentation gaps likely",
        "expected_issues": "Agent configuration, communication setup"
    },
    {
        "name": "Django",
        "type": "framework",
        "complexity": "medium",
        "why": "Mature but complex, lots of concepts",
        "expected_issues": "Settings.py complexity, database setup"
    }
]
```

### Week 3: Stress Testing (2-3 tools)

```python
test_targets_week3 = [
    {
        "name": "AWS boto3",
        "type": "api",
        "complexity": "complex",
        "why": "Notorious for poor error messages, complex auth",
        "expected_issues": "Credential setup, service permissions, error messages"
    },
    {
        "name": "Apache Airflow", 
        "type": "platform",
        "complexity": "complex",
        "why": "Complex setup, multiple concepts, production concerns",
        "expected_issues": "Database setup, DAG configuration, scheduler"
    }
]
```

## Tool Identification Strategy

### Where to Find Good Candidates:

**1. Developer Survey Pain Points**
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey - tools with high "dreaded" scores
- GitHub issues with "documentation" or "getting started" labels
- Reddit r/Python complaints about specific tools

**2. Your Own Experience**
- Tools you've personally struggled with
- Tools your colleagues complain about
- Tools that took you longer than expected to implement

**3. Industry Lists**
- Python Package Index (PyPI) - popular packages with poor docs
- Awesome Python Lists - tools across different categories
- Y Combinator Company Tools - newer tools with potentially incomplete docs

### Quick Validation Method:

Before committing to test a tool, do this 5-minute check:

```python
validation_questions = [
    "Can I find clear installation instructions?",
    "Are there code examples in the first page of docs?", 
    "Is authentication/setup clearly explained?",
    "Can I identify 3-5 core use cases?",
    "Are there obvious gaps or confusing sections?"
]
```

If you get mixed answers, it's a perfect test candidate.

## The Secret Sauce

**Target tools where you already know the pain points.** This lets you validate that your agent correctly identifies real problems.

**Example:** If you know Django's settings.py is confusing for beginners, test whether your agent flags this in its evaluation.

**Start with OpenWeatherMap API + Requests + FastAPI** - they're simple enough to debug your agent, but comprehensive enough to establish your testing methodology.
